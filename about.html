<p>Hi! I'm J. Singleton! I'm trained as a lawyer but have spent the last several years working as a legal technology project manager for legal aid (a group of non-profit law firms). After managing everything from basic website administration, to document assembly projects, to most recently, a Drupal 8 build with React app, I'm ready to take a deep dive into the world of web development. </p>
