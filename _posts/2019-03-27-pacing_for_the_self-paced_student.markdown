One of my biggest worries before beginning Flatiron's self-paced program, and one that I've heard echoed by many other students, was how to ensure I'd make steady progress in my coding journey while balancing Flatiron with a full-time job and my personal life. Three months in I thought I'd share three of the strategies (and accompanying books and tech tools) that have helped me stick to (and even beat!) my self-imposed schedule.

## 1. Create an Interactive Schedule
During my first meeting with my educational coach, I shared my concerns about staying on track. My coach Talia (who has been super!) gave me an incredibly helpful 20/hr a week schedule. The schedule lays out which sections I should be completing, broken down by week. Armed with this schedule, I created a handy [Google Sheet to track my progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5axaT5eOs7Cv4vMg48hCRpniH4mB0Vwq13pCVLYV24/edit?usp=sharing). My Google Sheet Schedule lets me know if I'm staying on pace, while also giving me the satisfaction of checking off each section I finish. I've also built in the ability to easily track how many hours I spend coding each day and each week. This helps me see trends and adjust accordingly. Whenever I open [learn.co](https://learn.co/), the next tab tends to be my [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5axaT5eOs7Cv4vMg48hCRpniH4mB0Vwq13pCVLYV24/edit?usp=sharing) so that I can log my progress right away.

## 2. Cultivate Your Ability to Work Deeply
I came across the concept of deep work ("the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task") a couple years ago after reading the [Cal Newport book](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by the same name. The book's premise is that, particularly for "knowledge workers," quality work product is the result of deep, focused periods of work in which you are free from distractions. I had already applied techniques such as pausing my inbox and batching tasks that take less concentration, but decided to check the book out from the library again when I started at Flatiron. The second read (or listen, as it were) has yielded even greater insights. 

My two biggest takeaways from my second read through the book have been: a) killing distractions, even in my free time; and b) taking a break when my concentration fails. 

### a) Kill Distractions
We all know we live in a distracted world. While I've always tried to be cautious about how I handle distractions in my life (see inbox pause above), my second reading of Deep Work led me to consider how distracted living during my free time impacts my ability to concentrate when I need to. I've deleted Instagram from my phone, haven't check Facebook in weeks, and have *almost* killed the impulse to look at my phone when I'm waiting for someone. By reducing the need to constantly have something capturing my attention, I can more easily focus on the really hard things when the time comes. Using the [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) app for short guided meditations has also been key to helping me learn to turn on my focus and tune out distractions.

While I'm coding, I don't allow myself to have any nonrelevant tabs open. One new tool I've been using is a browser extension call [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/), which functions similarly to a Pomodoro timer, with a little added incentive. When you set your timer, you plant a seed. If you visit any blacklisted sites, your tree dies. If you stay focused, you can grow a tree, and eventually, a forest!

**Tech Tools**
* [Forest browser extension](https://www.forestapp.cc/)
* [Headspace mediation app](https://www.headspace.com/)
* Delete social media from your phone!

### b) Take a Break (and get some sleep!)
Studies cited in Deep Work estimate that most people can't muster more than about 4 hours of deep work in a day. When you reach your threshold, I've found that taking a break is the most effective use of your time. Each time I've found myself truly stuck on a lab, I've found that taking a break, ideally to do something that uses a completely different part of my brain, is the best way to get unstuck. I find that once I get back to my coding, I quickly find the solution to the problem I had been stuck on. Especially if I'm coding in the evening after a long day at work, I keep close tabs on how well my brain is functioning. The brain can solve some gnarly problems while asleep and sometimes it's best to trust that process rather than unproductively spinning your wheels. Read Matthew Walker's [Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316) if you don't believe me.

**Tech Tools**
* I use the [Twilight App](https://twilight.urbandroid.org/) to make sure the blue light emitted by my phone doesn't interfere with my sleep cycle.

## 3. Cultivate Good Habits & Kill the Bad Ones
When you're trying to juggle learning to code along with a full-time job, family, friends, and your health, being able to conserve brainpower during your daily tasks can be key. I recently read James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and was struck by the concept that by automating certain tasks in your life (i.e., make them habits), you won't need to think about them or exert your willpower, leaving more brainspace and willpower. This is especially useful on low motivation days when catching up on your Game of Thrones recaps sounds more enticing than sitting down to code.

Atomic Habits presents 4 laws of habits, each of which presents a new opportunity to strengthen (or weaken) a habit: 
   1. Make It Obvious (your cue to start the habit), 
   2. Make It Attractive (why you want to do the habit), 
   3. Make It Easy (reducing barriers to completing the habit), 
   4. Make It Satisfying (that immediate reward our brains love). 

With my interactive schedule, checking those boxes and logging hours both give me that immediate hit of satisfaction that is so compelling. I've also learned to leave my laptop in the same spot so that when I'm ready to code, I know exactly where it is and don't risk wandering around the house looking for it (and potentially getting distracted).

I've also used Atomic Habits to create a great morning routine -- while that routine doesn't involve coding, it does make sure the rest of my life is on track, which supports my coding efforts. Each morning I make my coffee and prepare my lunch while the coffee brews. I then complete three lessons on Duolingo, meditate with Headspace for ten minutes, and do some push-ups and a plank. (Oh, and I also pick up my socks, a habit my partner requested I start cultivating.) 
I'm not allowed to check emails or texts until I finish this routine. 

While not directly related to coding, this routine helps me start my day in a focused and thoughtful mindset. This in turns makes it more likely that the rest of my day will follow suit, leaving me in a good place when it comes time for coding. 

## Continue Optimizing
Just as with a coding project, I'll continue to optimize my strategies for balancing coding pursuits with my other priorities. While the core concepts will remain, I'll need to continually readjust as life evolves.
