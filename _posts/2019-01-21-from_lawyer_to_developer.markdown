If you had told me 5 years ago that I would be enrolled in a full-stack web development course (and loving it!), I would have had some serious questions for you! Five years ago, I was leaving a private law firm to take a job with legal aid where I would support statewide access to justice initiatives. While I understood that technology would be part of the job, I was most excited about organizing continuing legal education programs for legal aid lawyers.

Fast-forward two years and my excitement had shifted to exploring how technology can be harnessed to make legal information and services more widely accessible. While I still organized trainings for legal aid lawyers, I had begun programming automated forms that guide users step-by-step through filling out court forms and other legal documents. I loved both the process -- learning programming concepts like conditional logic and while loops -- and the outcome -- making intimidating legal forms more understandable and easier to complete.

Though I had discovered that I loved programming automated forms, I was still intimidated by what I thought of as "real programming." One of the projects I managed was an online interface that allowed potential clients to send an application to the legal aid organization most likely to be able to serve them. Under my management, this project grew to include several additional legal aid organizations. This expansion required incorporating these organizations into the routing logic of the program and integrating the intake application with the organizations' case management systems. 

The first round of expansions was contracted out to developers. For the second round, however, the integrations were less complex and my manager asked if I felt comfortable handling the integrations myself. After digging into the PHP and JavaScript files, I found that what had previously looked like a foreign language became understandable once I studied the code and broke it down into smaller pieces. Little in my legal career matched the satisfaction of seeing my code come to life in the form of custom pages on the web app, email triggers, and custom fields within those emails.

The project that gave me my final push into web development was rebuilding Minnesota’s legal information website, [LawHelpMN.org](https://www.lawhelpmn.org/) in Drupal 8, with a React app. As part of the project, I built a [relational database of the state’s legal services providers](https://openreferral.org/open-referral-powers-two-new-tools-for-minnesotans-seeking-legal-aid/) using a national data standard, Open Referral. This database, along with a taxonomy of legal terms that I created, became the backbone of the website. While I didn’t get to write the code for the website, planning the architecture of the site and working closely with the developers to implement that plan confirmed that I wanted the skills to write my ideas in code.

As I begin my journey at Flatiron, I am excited about the possibilities these new skills will bring. Much like the law, technology is infused within every industry, and increasingly, within every aspect of life. And as cheesy as it sounds, just like the law, I see so much potential to leverage technology to make the world a better place.
