As I enter my second month of coding with Flatiron, my appreciation for the errors I work through during test-driven development (TDD) has continued to deepen. In the beginning, I loved the thrill of seeing green once I had written code that passed a test. While I still love that feeling of making a test pass, I've also started to love the red!

The tests included in the Flatiron labs are written in a way to guide me step-by-step through the process of writing my code. When I first began working through labs, I often tried writing all code I could before running `rspec`. As the labs have grown more complex and my understanding of using test driven development has deepened, I've learned to start with the red by first running `rspec` and then work through the error messages.

An unexpected benefit of learning to program in this manner is that it forces me to remain humble and open-minded. The hardest errors I've encountered have been when I was sure I was right! If I ever get an error and find myself thinking, "My code must be right -- maybe there's an issue with the test..." I know it's time for me to step back and look at the problem with fresh eyes. This approach keeps me humble and back to basics – Have I checked for spelling errors? – and open to new and creative ways of approaching problems – Is it time to hit up Google? I certainly don't everything about coding now, nor will I ever -- and that's a great thing!

A final bit of unexpected joy I've found with TDD is refactoring. There's the initial thrill of getting your code to pass, but the game of refactoring soon follows. If I move the responsibility for this bit of the program into its own method, will my code still work, or did I interfere with a different part of the puzzle? Can I experiment with a different syntax that’s easier to read and still get my code pass? This process of refactoring builds my confidence back up to a healthy level: not only can I get the code to pass, but I can get it to pass in many different ways!
